For those who don't remember (or choose to forget), tamagotchis were "digital pets" that you could carry around with you and feed them, clean up after them, pet them, and try to keep them happy.

## Before you start!!

- Open up `tamagotchi-test.html` in your browser. Yikes!! Lots of red. You'll work on getting those tests passing.
- Open up `src/tamagotchi.js`. This is where you'll be doing your work.

# Tamagotchi Version 1.0

Make a ```tamagotchi``` object. Give it the following properties:  
1. a hungry property (initially false)  
2. a sick property (initially false)  
3. an age of 0  
4. a rest level (initally set to 5)

Give it the following methods:</br>

1. ```feed()``` - if hungry is true, return "That was yummy!" and set hungry to false.  If hungry is false, return "No thanks, I'm full." and set hungry to true.  
2. ```sleep()``` - returns "zzzzzzz" (use as many z's as you want) and increase rest level
3. ```medicate()``` - if sick is true, return "I feel much better!" and set sick to false.  If sick is false, return "No thanks, I feel fine." and set sick to true.
4. ```increaseAge()``` - increase the age by one and return "Happy Birthday to me! I am " + age + " years old!"

## We are going to build a three custom tamagotchi objects:
Use your custom tamagotchi object... to create each of these
- dog
- cat
- fish

**There will be LOTS of repeated code!!!  We know!!!**

### dog should be the same as tamagotchi except it should also have these abilities:
1. ```bark()``` - returns "ruff ruff  
2. ```goOutside()``` - returns "I own that tree now!"  

### cat should be the same as tamagotchi except it should also have these abilities:
1. ```meow()``` - returns "Meow!"  
2. ```useLitterBox()``` - returns "Burried treasure!"  

### fish should be the same as tamagotchi except it should also have these abilities:
1. ```swim()``` - returns "Just keep swimming..."  

---

Try the following:  
1. Feed the dog twice.  
2. Increase the dog's age twice.  
3. Make the dog bark.  
4. Make the dog go outside.  
5. Make the cat meow.  
6. Make the cat sleep.  
7. Make the cat use the litter box.  
8. Give the fish medicine twice.  
9. Make the fish swim.

Bonus:  What is missing from our tamagotchis?!?!  Build it!

### AFTER Completing the above exercise...
- Identify which parts of your tamagotchis share the SAME attributes
- Identify which parts of your tamagotchis share the SAME abilities
- Identify the differences

---

### Now, let's use the Class object with a Constructor Function.....
- Rewrite the Tamagotchi object with a constructor function!
- Create several tamagotchi objects using your constructor :D
